## About me

### My developer journey
My name is Marco Zintl and I'm currently studying web development at 
[Mid Sweden University](https://www.miun.se/). My journey as a developer began 
in late 2019 through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), which 
taught me the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript until I decided to apply to Miun.
My goal is to eventually land a job as a web developer.

### My profile
This profile will showcase personal projects and a few Miun assignments 
(this README happens to belong to the latter category). As you can see, 
I have been creating simple web applications since 2020, but I didn't care to 
add any personal information to my profile until recently.

### Programming languages
As of 2022, I am (more or less) familiar with the following programming 
languages:
* JavaScript
* PHP
* MySQL/SQL
* C#

### Web development/design
As of 2022, I am (more or less) familiar with the following tools/techniques:
* HTML

* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* WordPress
* Git
* Adobe XD
* ASP.NET Core

### Who am I?
I'm 33 years old and I live in Sweden. I was born in Germany, but I grew up in Sweden,
so I'm bilingual. I am, in fact, a language nerd. I speak German, Swedish, English and French.
I actually worked as a freelance translator for a few years.

I love lifting! I hit the gym four times a week. Oh, and I love tea, as one of my repos should tell you.
